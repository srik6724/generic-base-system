//Simulation of a 4v4 match 

//Outline of a 4v4 match 

//Retrieve the names of the players enrolled in the match. 

//Retrieve the levels of the players enrolled in the match. 

//Retrieve the schools or identities of the players enrolled in the match. 

//Process for a Round listed below. 

//Set a clock for 30 seconds for the first team to make their move. 
//This also includes discarding cards to select the move they want to use. 

//Ask Player 1, whatever name to make their move and who they decide to cast it on. 
//Give the following 4 options of the opposing team. 

//Then ask Player 2, whatever name to make their move and who they decide to cast it on. 
//Give the following 4 opposing players of the opposing team. 

//Then ask Player 3, whatever name to make their move and who they decide to cast it on. 
//Give the following 4 opposing players of the opposing team. 

//Then ask Player 4, whatever name to make their move and who they decide to cast it on. 
//Give the following 4 opposing players of the opposing team. 

//End the clock right here and there, because now the next team will make their move. 
//Make methods to retrieve info about player information every consecutive round 
//regarding their health, their current hand, etc.

//----------------------------END OF ROUND-------------------------------------------

//Apply health deduction changes after this health clock resets. 

//Repeat the process for the next round. 

//-----------------------------FEATURES----------------------------------------------
//Match only ends when every person's health is at 0. 
//There should be an option to flee any time during a round and that option will be 
//given as self-select. If this happens, the match is considered to be ended
//and the simulation will stop. 

//Options can also be given to add spectators in the arena and a count of all spectators will be given. 
//Betting on these matches will also be a thing.

//Before the 4v4 match starts, an application is going to be made to create your own self-starting deck
//of 64 cards. This will include the main deck and side deck.

//Implement database of all 4v4 pvp spells in mySQL Database.


//Possible Combinations of 4v4 matches. 
//Consider death jade and life jade as part of the team already. 
//Just consider 2 jades for the time-being.
